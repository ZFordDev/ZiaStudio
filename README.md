## **Overview**

ZiaStudio is a lightweight AI chat desktop application built with Electron and designed for stability and long‑term maintainability.

It is part of the **StaxDash premium toolset**, working seamlessly alongside apps like **SnapDock** and the upcoming **ClipDash**.  
ZiaStudio provides a clean, focused interface for interacting with local or cloud AI backends, prioritising reliability and interconnectivity over unnecessary complexity.

ZiaStudio aims to be the **go‑to desktop app for simple, predictable, connected AI**.

---

## 🧪 **Active Beta**

ZiaStudio is currently in **active Beta**.

The core experience is functional, but you may encounter:

- UI rough edges  
- Occasional bugs  
- Incomplete features  
- Rapid iteration  

The goal during Beta is to refine stability, polish the interface, and prepare the app for long‑term support.
